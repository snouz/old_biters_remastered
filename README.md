# Old Biters Remastered

Proto-biters are visually an upgraded version of the old biters from before 0.17. They currently have the exact same stats, and they spawn at the same rate, but on different point on nauvis than normal biters. They drop alien artefacts (currently no use without additional mods)

Modders: feel free to add them to a different planet.
