# Proto-biters

Proto-biters are an upscaled and reworked version of the old biters from before 0.17. They currently have the exact same stats, and they spawn at the same rate, but on different point on nauvis than normal biters. They drop alien artefacts (currently no use without additional mods)

Modders: feel free to add them to a different planet.

I plan to make them more distinct from new biters, and to improve some of the graphics.
